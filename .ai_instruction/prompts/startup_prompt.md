# PyBaseEnv Governance Onboarding

You are about to work on a Python project built from PyBaseEnv.

## IMPORTANT: COLD START

You must assume ZERO prior knowledge of this project. Do not rely on memory, pattern matching, or assumptions. Derive everything strictly from files in this repository.

---

## TASK

1. Locate `.ai_instruction/A00_start_here.md`
2. Read it IN FULL
3. Follow the mandatory reading order exactly:
   - Phase 1: Governance (A00 → A01 → A02 → A03)
   - Phase 2: Templates (project_structures.md, script_templates.py, GUI templates)
   - Phase 3: Core API (core_foundation → core_utilities → core_integrations → core_quick_lookup)
   - Phase 4: GUI API (if applicable)
   - Phase 5: Consolidation (quick_lookup docs)
4. After EACH document, state:
   - Document name
   - 2–3 key rules or takeaways
   - Any ambiguity or uncertainty
5. Do NOT skip ahead, summarise early, or generate code during onboarding

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- Do NOT invent rules
- Do NOT assume conventions
- Do NOT apply "standard Python practices" unless explicitly stated
- Do NOT reference anything outside this repository

---

## COMPLETION

After reading ALL documents:

1. Confirm you are now governed
2. List which rules are ABSOLUTE vs ADVISORY
3. Identify any gaps that would block code generation

Then generate `CLAUDE.md` that:
- Gives future sessions immediate awareness of this project's rules
- Lists ABSOLUTE rules (imports, structure, facades, templates)
- Includes the anti-patterns table (don't → do)
- Includes rule precedence hierarchy
- Includes the 6-step workflow
- Includes quick reference for common tasks
- Stays CONCISE — this loads every session
- Points to `.ai_instruction/A00_start_here.md` for full onboarding

Do NOT just summarise docs. Synthesise what you learned into actionable memory.

## THEN

Ask for the first task.
