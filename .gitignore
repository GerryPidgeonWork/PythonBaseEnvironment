.gitignore for Python Boilerplate Project

This file tells Git which files and folders to intentionally ignore.

CRITICAL: This file is designed to PREVENT you from accidentally committing
sensitive credentials (like 'token.json') or large, unnecessary folders
(like '.venv', 'cache', or 'outputs') to your repository.

This file is SAFE to reuse across all Python boilerplate and application repos.
